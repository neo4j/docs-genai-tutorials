= Find movies similar to another movie

To find movies whose embedding is similar to that of a specific movie, retrieve the movie and feed its embedding to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/#query-vector-index[Cypher procedure `db.index.vector.queryNodes]`.

When xref:query/search-prompt.adoc[retrieving nodes matching a search prompt], the results from OpenAI and SentenceTransformers didn't differ much.
On the other hand, in the example above they perform very differently: OpenAI is able to relate the three _minion_ movies, whereas `Despicable Me 2` and `Minions` don't show up in the results from SentenceTransformers.

How come `Despicable Me 2` does not show up in the top five closest movies to `Despicable Me`, with SentenceTransformers embeddings?
Given that embeddings are generated on titles and plots, let's look at how the plots for the two movies relate.

These read like entirely different movies: what was a `criminal mastermind` is now `Gru, the world's most super-bad`; there's no more `trio of orphan girls`; there were no `minions` in the plot of the first movie.

Although today everybody associates `Despicable Me` with `minions`, that is not how it was described and marketed when the movie first came out.
`Minions` stack really well in the public culture, which made them the main center of marketing _afterward_.
The embedding model simply doesn't have all this context -- one that comes from having lived in the world for a decade, day in, day out.

OpenAI seems to be able to relate the three _minion_ movies even if the plots alone don't look too similar.
Why OpenAI behaves in this way has entirely to do with how its model was trained.
If anything though, it's more surprising that OpenAI relates them correctly than SentenceTransformers failing at seeing a link in them.
