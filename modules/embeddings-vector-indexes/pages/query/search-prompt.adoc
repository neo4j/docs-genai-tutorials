= Find movies given a search prompt

Once movies nodes have an embedding encoding their title and plot, and a xref:setup/vector-index.adoc[vector index] on those embeddings is present in the database, you can retrieve movies matching a loose description (a _search prompt_), a bit like you would query a search engine to find relevant web pages based on a few keywords.

The examples in this page show how to retrieve movies that relate to the prompt `a criminal is changed through love`.
You may imagine it akin to going to the movie teather and asking: "What movies would you recommend to me? Today I feel inspired by movies in which a criminal is changed through love."
The main difference is that at the theater the conversation takes place in natural language, whereas to search in the database the prompt is first turned into an embedding.
The vector index can then use the prompt embedding to retrieve the nodes whose embedding is most similar to the search prompt.

[TIP]
**Always use the same model to generate embeddings**: pick one and use it to generate embeddings for both the dataset and search prompts.
Attempting to mix models with different vector sizes will result in an error.
Models with the same vector size will work, but are unlikely to interact well with one another, as they most likely differ in the way they were trained.

<1> It is important to generate the embedding for the search prompt with the same model as the one used to generate the embeddings that you search among.
xref:embeddings/sentence-transformers.adoc[This tutorial] used `all-MiniLM-L6-V2` to generate embeddings and it is re-used here as well.
<2> The _query prompt_ contains a loose description of movies to retrieve.
It is then encoded into an embedding, so that it can be used to query for similar nodes.
<3> To query the vector index, use the Cypher procedure link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/#indexes-vector-query[`db.index.vector.queryNodes`].
The database returns the `5` most similar nodes to `query_embedding` from the vector index `moviePlots`, together with the `score` of how well they match the query embedding.

== Quality of matches

**The quality of matches depends entirely on the embedding model and on the dataset, not on the Neo4j vector index.**
Embeddings are always generated _outside_ of Neo4j; the database only _stores_ them as properties.

Consider the nodes retrieved with the search prompt `a criminal is changed through love` using SentenceTransformers (OpenAI's results are similar):

This example shows that embeddings worked according to expectations: `Despicable Me` comes up third with a relevance score of 77%.
At the same time, it shows the **limitations of embedding models**, as it retrieved movies that don't really relate to the prompt:

- `Laura` has no "criminal changed through love", but it has a `police detective` (who often works with `criminals`) who falls in `love` in the context of a `murder` (again related to `criminals`).
- `Laws of Attraction` has no `criminals` at all, but it has: `attraction`, which relates to `love`; `litigation`, which usually happens in courts, which are related to `criminals`; `lawyers`, who are often associated with `criminals`; and `love`, although among _lawyers_.
- `Love the Hard Way` has it almost the other way around: an innocent student falls in `love` with a lower version of a `criminal` (a `petty thief`), and enters a downward spiral.

Even if these movies hardly relate to the search prompt, _the database is right_: they are the most relevant ones, _according to the embeddings_.
Why the embeddings don't encode meaning in they way one may expect is a question that has nothing to do with vector indexes, and everything to do with the external AI models.
**If your search prompts return poor results**, you should investigate the embedding model and the dataset it is applied to, rather than tweaking the Neo4j side of things.
