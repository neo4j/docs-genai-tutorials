= Environment setup

At a minimum, you need the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/[Neo4j Python language library] to interact with your Neo4j instance.
More packages might be needed depending on how you decide to generate embeddings.

The following examples show how to create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the `neo4j` package.

.Create and activate a virtual environment called `embeddings`
[source, shell]
----
python -m venv virtualenvs/embeddings
source virtualenvs/embeddings/bin/activate
----

.Install the `neo4j` package
[source, shell]
----
pip install neo4j
----

Once your environment is set up, go on to enrich each `Movie` node with an embedding of its title and plot, either with xref:embeddings/sentence-transformers.adoc[open source libraries] or with xref:embeddings/cloud-providers.adoc[cloud AI providers].
